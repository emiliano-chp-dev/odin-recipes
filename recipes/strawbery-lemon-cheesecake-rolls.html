    <h1>Strawbery-Lemon Cheesecake Rolls</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These Strawberry Lemon Cheesecake Rolls are the sunniest twist on classic sweet rolls. Each fluffy pastry is
        filled with rich strawberry preserves, baking into a gooey, fruit-filled bite. The finishing touch, a creamy,
        lemon cheesecake-flavored topping, adds just the right amount of tangy sweetness.

        “These rolls have a little bit of everything in one—and I love that!” said recipe tester Amanda Stanfield.
        “Perfect for really any time of the day too, breakfasts, snacks, or for dessert. These hit the spot.”

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small saucepan, heat 1 cup of the milk to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C) over low heat, about 5 minutes.
            Pour warm milk into a liquid measuring cup, and stir in sugar and yeast; let sit until foamy, about 5
            minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat flour, eggs, butter, salt, and 1 teaspoon of the lemon zest with a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook
            attachment on medium speed until crumbly, about 1 minute. With mixer on low speed, slowly stream in milk
            mixture until fully combined, then increase speed to medium-low, and beat until a smooth dough forms, 8 to
            12 minutes. If needed, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough is too sticky.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer dough to a greased 13- x 9-inch baking pan, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in
            size, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; roll into a 18- x 15-inch rectangle (about 1/4 inch
            thick). Spread 1 1/2 cups of the preserves evenly over bottom two-thirds of the dough starting on 1 long
            side, leaving a 1/2-inch border.
        </li>
        <li>
            Carefully roll dough into a log starting at long side with with preserves. Some of the preserves may spill
            out as you roll, that’s okay. Slice dough log into 12 rolls, and arrange, cut sides down, back into greased
            baking pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place, until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25
            minutes. Brush remaining 1/4 cup preserves evenly over rolls. Let cool slightly at room temperature, about 5
            minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, stir together cheesecake filling, lemon curd, lemon juice, remaining 3 tablespoons milk, and
            remaining 1 teaspoon lemon zest in a medium bowl until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drizzle desired amount of lemon curd mixture over warm rolls.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve any remaining lemon curd mixture on the side.
        </li>
    </ol>
